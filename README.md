# Melody

<img src="./public/images/logo.png" width="50%">

A music-based social media app built using the Spotify API. See what your friends are listening to, post your favorite songs from your favorite artists, and find new music today!

## Motivation

I felt like it was somewhat of a taboo to post music on your Instagram/Snap story, but I wanted a way to both post my music and find new songs to listen to. Thus, Melody was created. 


## Installation

Clone the application and run ``` npm install ``` in the project directory. To start the application, run ``` npm start ```, and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/). The app is connected to a MongoDB, so feel free to sign up and test out the application!

## How to Use

The application flow is similar to that of a normal social media application. To select a song to post, type in the name of the song and either select an option from the dropdown menu or click post and the song will be on your post.
The navbar consists of links for the home feed, your profile, notifications (the music notes- still in development), and a search bar (still in development).
